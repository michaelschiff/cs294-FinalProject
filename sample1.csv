<p>I'm trying to decide if I should create SocketAsyncEventArgs for each connected socket and send all the packets at once. </p>

<p>Another approach would be to use a single SocketAsyncEventArgs and send the packets one after another. Then it would be tempting to call SendAsync in the ProcessSend method (which is called when SendAsync has completed) and have a queue of connected sockets. But what if for some reason SendAsync will not complete in a reasonable amount of time? Is there any scenario that would make it never to complete?</p>

Or do I need to check endianness like I would in C and then write separate code for the two cases?</p>

So whenever I query a record for the mastertable I also geht the ""latest"" data of the History Table.</p>

<pre><code>Master Table
  ID
  FIRSTNAME
  LASTNAME
  ...

History Table
  ID
  LASTACTION
  DATE
</code></pre>

<p>This is possible by joining both tables and using a subselect to retrieve the latest history table record as described in the answer given in the link above. </p>

<p>My Quesions are:
How can I solve the problem, that there might be in theory two History Records with the same date? </p>

<p>Is this kind of joining with the subselect really the best solution in terms of performance (and in general)? What do you think (I am NO expert in all this stuff) if I integrate a further attribute in the History table that is named ""ISLATESTRECORD"" as a boolean Flag that I manage manually (and that has a unique constrained). This attribute will then explicitly mark the latest record and I do not need any subselects as I can directly use this attribute in the where clause of the join.
On the other hand, this makes inserting a new record of course a little bit more complicated: I first have to remove the ""ISLATESTRECORD"" flag from the latest record, I have to insert the new History Record with the ""ISLATESTRECORD"" set and commit the transaction. </p>

<p>What do you think is the recommended solution? I do not have any clue about the performance impact of the subselects: I might have millions of ""Mastertable"" Records"" that I have to search for a specific record also using in the search attributes of the joined History table like: ""Give me the Mastertable Record with FIRSTNAME XYZ and the LASTACTION (of the History Table) was ""changed_name"". So this subselect might be called millions of times. </p>

<p>Or is it better work with a subselect to find the latest record, as subselects are very efficient and its better to keep everything normalized?</p>

<p>Sadly this is for a company project so i can't publish the code here. I will try to anonymise the code but i was hoping that if someone else had the same issue they could shed some light on the issue.</p>

<p>Note: the extra code disapears when i refresh the page. it only happens when coming from another page. could this be a catch issue with firefox?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I discovered that i was loading jQuery in the header. not sure what this was doing but now the page 'freaks out' no matter what.</p>

<p>This is what the code should be:</p>

This control inherits a Panel and implements the IScriptControl (in order to enable the Ajax component of the control).</p>

<p>It's pretty simple actually. It's essentially a Panel that has a style of <em>overflow:scroll</em> (it's a ""scrollable Panel"") and it remembers it's scroll position between asynchronous postbacks to the server so that the scroll position is not reset to 0,0 when the asynchronous postback returns.</p>

<p>Everything's been working for some time now (years) but I never tried to make this control invisible (server side). Even if I set the parent of this control to Visible=false this control is not working properly.</p>

<p>I'm getting an exception thrown by the Ajax.NET framework in the web browser:</p>

<p><strong><em>Error: Sys.ScriptLoadFailedException: The script ""http://UrlToAScript"" contains multiple calls to Sys.Application.notifyScriptLoaded(). Only one is allowed.</em></strong></p>

<p>It has something to do with the Render event not being fired (because the control is not visible, it's not rendered so the Render event doesn't actually take place). When the control is made visible (and the Render event does take place) I'm seeing the exception in the web browser (client side) stating that it's registered more than once. (Hopefully I'm speaking to an audience that understands that the ScriptDescriptors are registered with the ScriptManager in the Render event of Ajax enabled server controls.)</p>

<p>Here is my implementation that handles the OnPreRender and Render events:</p>

<pre><code>Protected Overrides Sub OnPreRender(ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
        Me.Style.Add(""overflow"", ""scroll"")

        If Not Me.DesignMode Then
            If ScriptManager Is Nothing Then
                Throw New HttpException(""A ScriptManager control must exist on the page."")
            End If
            ScriptManager.RegisterScriptControl(Me)

    End Sub
    Protected Overrides Sub Render(ByVal writer As System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter)
        'Register the ScrollContiner's script descriptors that are created by the GetScriptDescriptors method
        If Not Me.DesignMode Then
            ScriptManager.RegisterScriptDescriptors(Me)
        End If
        MyBase.Render(writer)
    End Sub
    Public Function GetScriptReferences() As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of System.Web.UI.ScriptReference) Implements System.Web.UI.IScriptControl.GetScriptReferences

        Dim reference As ScriptReference = New ScriptReference()
        reference.Name = ""MyNamespace.ScrollContainer.js""
        reference.Assembly = ""MyNamespace""

        Return New ScriptReference() {reference}
    End Function 
    Public Function GetScriptDescriptors() As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of System.Web.UI.ScriptDescriptor) Implements System.Web.UI.IScriptControl.GetScriptDescriptors
        Dim descriptor As ScriptControlDescriptor = New ScriptControlDescriptor(""MyNamespace.ScrollContainer"", Me.ClientID)
        descriptor.AddProperty(""LeftScrollPosition"", Me.LeftScrollPosition)
        descriptor.AddProperty(""RightScrollPosition"", Me.RightScrollPosition)

<p>I can see this possibly being a problem if there are many processes running similar code with long execution times between iterations of the IEnumerable object, because the connections will be open longer, etc. However, it also seems plausible that this will reduce the CPU usage on the SQL server because it only returns data when the IEnumerable object is used. It also lowers memory usage on the client because the client only has to load one instance of MyType while it works rather than loading all occurrences of MyType (by iterating through the entire DataReader and returning a List or something).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there any instances you can think of where you would not want to use IEnumerable in this manner, or any instances you think it fits perfectly?</p></li>

"1400194","1","Dojo build -> dojo.require(); still needed?","4","<build><dojo>","2009-09-09 14:47:41","1554","2009-09-09 16:18:04","2009-09-10 16:06:53","<p>this was my first dojo build so please excuse my ignorance in this matter.</p>

<p>I've just created my custom build from dojo build system using the following (very simplified) profile:</p>

<pre><code>dependencies = {
stripConsole: ""normal"",

layers: [		
	{
		name: ""../dijits/cx/dijitsCXbuild.js"",
		copyrightFile: ""CopyrightCX.txt"",
		dependencies: [
			""dojo.parser"",
			""dijit.dijit"",				 
			""dijit._Widget"",
			""dijit._Templated"",
			""dijit._Container"",
			""dojo.i18n"",
			""dojo.NodeList-fx"",
			""dojox.grid.cells"",
			""dojox.grid.DataGrid"",
			""dojox.layout.GridContainer"",
			""dijit.TitlePane"",
			""dijits.cx.TaskPanel"",
			""dijits.cx.Identify""
		]
	}
],

prefixes: [        
    [ ""dijit"", ""../dijit"" ],
	[ ""dojox"", ""../dojox"" ],
    [ ""dijits.cx"", ""../dijits/cx"" ]
]
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>... well, it all proceeds fine and I get my own package with everything I requested. Then in my webapp I include the following</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  djConfig = {
    isDebug:false,
    parseOnLoad:true,
    locale:getLocale()
  };
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""Lib/cxdojo/dojo/dojo.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""Lib/cxdojo/dijits/cx/dijitsCXbuild.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... looks ok, until the code needs to instantiate the first dijit and it fails with the notorious : ""dijits.cx. TaskPanel is not a constructor.""</p>

<p>I can get rid of this problem by including the ""dojo.require()"" but that's something I though I'll get rid of by creating my custom own build. Any ideas of what am I doing wrong or what shall I do in order to avoid that 'dojo.require()' lines...
thanks heaps.</p>

<p>Can this be done though IIS?  I know that I can restrict IP addresses through IIS, but can I also use usernames/passwords?</p>

"1400199","1","Repository layout (or hook) for branching shared libraries (and keeping your sanity)","4","<svn><version-control><tortoisesvn><shared-libraries>","2009-09-09 14:48:29","689","2009-09-17 17:16:01","2009-09-23 14:54:26","<p>We're using subversion, (the question could be applicable to many version control systems, but subversion is the one I really care about.)</p>

<p>Our repository layout looks like so:</p>

<p><strong>(Layout A)</strong></p>

<pre><code>Web
  branches
  tags
  trunk
Libraries
  Foo
	branches
	tags
	trunk
  Bar
	branches
	tags
	trunk
WindowsClient
  branches
  tags
  trunk
DB
  branches
  tags
  trunk
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the unit of versioning is not equal to the unit of development -- I have to do multiple checkouts to get a buildable artifact, and when I branch, I have to branch multiple components (and check in in multiple places.)</p>

<p>This implies that we could instead move to a structure like this:</p>

<p><strong>(Layout B)</strong></p>

<pre><code>Web
  branches
  tags
  trunk
    main
	libs
	  Foo
	  Bar
	DB
WindowsClient
  branches
  tags
  trunk
    main
	libs
	  Foo
	  Baz
	DB
</code></pre>

<p>But then we have duplicate copies of any shared libraries. We could map the shared libs in using svn:externals, but that's just an illusion -- They won't be branched when the containing project is.</p>

<p>A final option is this:</p>

<p><strong>(Layout C)</strong></p>

<pre><code>branches
tags
trunk
  Web
  Libraries
    Foo
    Bar
  WindowsClient
  DB
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that libraries are branched along with their containing project, but at the cost that the unit of branching is the whole world. (This also implies that the unit of checkout is the whole world, which is annoying too.)</p>

<p>What I want is a repository layout <strong>(Layout D)</strong> that allows me to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Branch a project and its dependent libraries all at once</li>
<li>Share libraries between projects</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice if I could check out the project and its libraries in one checkout, but that is not nearly as important as the above.</p>

<p>So the question is:</p>

<p><strong>Is there a Layout D, What is it, and how do I use it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since it appears there isn't a basic layout that will give me these properties, I'd be very interested in some kind of hook function to get me there. It would be especially nice if it will work with the TortoiseSVN (Windows GUI) client, since that's what we're using.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to specify that each class should use it's own <code>next_hi</code>?</p>

<p>To clarify, I'd like to end up with something like <code>customer_next_hi</code> and <code>order_next_hi</code>, assuming it works based on columns.  If it's row based then that's fine too, provided each entity knows which row to use for it's <code>next_hi</code> value.</p>

<p>It's an HTTP 405 status code. All other forms in the application work, so I believe that the IIS 'verbs' setting for PHP pages is correct.</p>

<p>This is a customer's server, which I have no access to for verifying settings or testing code. All I can do is send the customer replacement files. Other customers on IIS servers have no such issue.</p>
