Is recommended to use synchronous requests (XMLHttpRequest) in a web worker? What problems can I find?</p>

<p>I have been testing this in my app and I haven't find any trouble. But I'm afraid of this synchronus behaviour because of old experiences with jQuery and AJAX.
My app gets a big amount of data from several tables in a database, and this requires a time. For each bunch of data retrieved from a table, I need to instantly process it to not delay the whole thing too much. Meanwhile, the user is interacting with the browser, so it can be blocked, and I thought that web workers would work fine.
Do you thing that this is a good solution? Or should I try with asynchronus requests?</p>

<p>Is it in any way possible to disable antialiasing when scaling up an image ?</p>

<p>Right now, i get something that looks like this :</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NXJxc.png"" alt=""What i get""></p>

<p>Using the following css code :</p>

<pre><code>#bib { width:104px;height:104px;background-image:url(/media/buttonart_back.png);background-size:1132px 1360px;
background-repeat:no-repeat;}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like, is something like this :</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/t1lml.png"" alt=""What i seek""></p>

<p>In short, any CSS flag to <strong>disable</strong> anti-aliasing from when scaling up images, preserving hard edges.</p>

<p>Any javascript hacks or similar are welcome too.</p>

<p>(Yes, I am aware that php and imagemagick can do this as well, but would prefer a css based solution.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
The following have been suggested :</p>

<pre><code>image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
image-rendering: -o-crisp-edges;
image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
-ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;

<p>The last question was closed as it was ""ambiguous"". So i'll try to be specific here:</p>

<p>Consider this website :

<p>and the reviews given at the bottom, 
I need to be able to open the profile of the reviewer, and extract information like age, sex and location if it is public. </p>

<p>A step-by-step process on how to achieve this would be appreciated.</p>

<p>PS : Is this do-able using scrapy ?</p>

<p>UPDATE : Assuming I have a database with the names of the users and i can directly open the member's profile for example, for Lulak</p>

I'm using the Razor syntax, and according to VS, I don't need to prefix <code>@</code> to statements if they are immediately preceded with another <code>@</code> statement, or once inside the code, the prefix <code>@</code> is no longer required.</p>

<p>So here is my code in my View:</p>

<pre><code>    @using (Html.BeginForm(""StudentSelect"", ""Home"", FormMethod.Post, new { id = ""sSelect"" }))  {

        Html.HiddenFor(m =&gt; m.SelectedStudent);
        foreach (Classes.CStudent item in Model.Students)
        {
            &lt;div class=""studentSelect""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""studentname""&gt;@item.StudentName&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;@item.Address&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;   
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Take not that the <code>Html.HiddenFor</code> and <code>foreach</code> lines do not have <code>@</code> prefix.
The generated HTML should produce a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> followed by a <code>&lt;input type=""hidden""&gt;</code> field.
However, upon checking the HTML on the generated page, the hidden input field is missing.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/Home/StudentSelect"" id=""sSelect"" method=""post""&gt;                
   &lt;div class=""studentSelect""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""studentname""&gt;Name1&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;AAA&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;

So far, these have been stored locally but I would like start storing and serving them via Amazon S3.</p>

<p>I've read Amazon's bucket and file naming rules which are clear, but I am wondering if there are other practical best practices for future maintainability.</p>

<p>Until now, I've been doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>User with GUID 31928 uploads image.jpg at 12-01-15 15:38:44</li>
<li>Thumbnail ""small"" gets stored as /s/28/19/3/31928/120115153844.jpg</li>
</ul>

<p>... where the the path is derived from the GUID and the image filename from the timestamp. This distributes files without creating massive folders, keeps everything sufficiently unique, and makes it possible for images to be matched against a GUID even manually. It's worked well so far.</p>

<p>With S3, I'll probably be serving these images from a single bucket but as the bucket cannot contain sub-folders, I'm curious as to how other people are storing large volumes of images. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>hash: 2fkoer983RoerWokfw.jpg</li>
<li>guid_hash: 31928_2fkoer983RoerWokfw.jpg</li>
<li>guid_size_hash: 31928_s_2fkoer983RoerWokfw.jpg</li>
<li>... or something else?</li>

I converted this to a .jar: </p>

<ul>
<li>I right clicked the class name (Sw3.java)</li>
<li>Selected ""Export"", then ""Java"", then ""JAR file""</li>
<li>Next, I chose current project name as resource to export, doubled clicked the ""Default package"" underneath it, selected desired class name from the list of classes in the right (Sw3.java)</li>
<li>Next, I ticked ""Export generated class files and resources"", selected the export destination as ""JAR file"" and placed it in ""Documents"" under the name ""Sw3.jar"". I also selected ""Compress the contents of the JAR file"".</li>
<li>In the next screen I checked ""Export class file with compile errors"" and ""Export class file with compile warnings"" </li>
</ul>

<p>I heard the right way to obtain an exe file is to convert a .jar into .exe so I used the ""Launch4j"" application with the .jar obtained previously:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the ""Basic"" panel: specified OUTPUT FILE: C:\Users\jerry\Documents\Sw3.exe and the JAR file: C:\Users\jerry\Documents\Sw3.jar. </li>
<li>Process priority NORMAL</li>
<li>Header type: GUI</li>
<li>MIN JRE Version: 1.0.0 </li>
<li>I pressed the ""wheel"" and chose Project.xml and got a succesful confirmation message.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have JRE installed, so the .exe should work, but it doesn't work. What did I do wrong? I would start by investigating if the .JAR was correctly obtained, is that a good approach and how would I check that? Thank you!</p>

<p>PS: Upon being advised to use JFrame instead of JApplet, I did that and still nothing happens when I double click the .exe in order to open it. This makes me suspect there is something wrong in the steps I described.</p>

<p>The binary runs perfectly o.k. with:</p>

<pre><code>./binary input.dat
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I put this inside a make file:</p>

<pre><code> SHELL=/bin/bash

 runos:
      ./binary input.dat
</code></pre>

<p>The code crashes and leaves me quite helpless.
Here is what I tested so far, everything inside my Make file and in the shell:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>ulimit -a</code>: identical.</li>
<li>Set the shell to bash as seen above.</li>
<li><p>diff of the environment variables in SHELL and Make with:</p>

<p><code>
  env | sort &gt; vars.1
</code></p>

<p>inside make</p>

<p><code>
  env | sort &gt; vars.2
</code></p>

<p>Then run the binary with the extra variables in Make with the following command:</p>

<p><code>
  env SHLVL=2 MAKELEVEL=1 MAKEFLAGS= ./binary input.dat
</code></p></li>
<li><p>strace in the shell and inside make:</p>

<p><code>
strace -o debug binary input.dat
</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The code keeps on crashing in Make, and runs in the shell. I am already thinking to dump Make for my test cases and just write shell scripts. But I am curious to know what is the difference. </p>

<p>The Fortran code (a mix of F77, F90 and F95) was compiled with gfortran-4.4 and the following options:</p>

<pre><code>FFLAGS= -g -fbacktrace
</code></pre>

<p>So, the concrete question is, what can I do to make this binary run under make in Debian!?</p>

<h3>update:</h3>

<p>I just tested again in a CentOS machine (v5.8), The code inside Makefile does not crash (GNU Make version 3.81).
I also tested on my Debian Wheezy and openSUSE 11.4, both with GNU Make version 3.82 - It crashes!
I tested on Debian Squeeze with GNU Make version 3.81, and it does crash. So, I think it is not dependent on the GNU Make version.</p>

<h3>error when crashing:</h3>

<pre><code> enter timeloop

<h3>trying to work around 'GNU Make' using 'waf'</h3>

<p>It has been a while since I wanted to test <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/waf/"" rel=""nofollow"">waf</a>, so here is another interesting observation:
I wrote a <code>wscript</code> which contains a function:</p>

<pre><code>import os

def run(ctx):
    os.system('./binary input.dat')
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>waf run</code> runs!</p>

<p>If I changed the <code>run</code> method to:</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess as sp
def run(ctx):
    sp.call('./binary input.dat', shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>The binary also <em>works</em> as expected. </p>

<p>So, now I am thinking <code>GNU Make</code> forks a new sub-shell in a way that causes may binary to fail (although, under RHEL 5.8 Make did work).</p>
